# 👨‍💻 Carlos Eduardo

👋 Hi there! I’m Carlos Eduardo — a passionate developer who blends logic with creativity to build digital solutions and explore new ideas.

🛠️ **Fullstack Web Developer** | Angular • Node.js • PostgreSQL  
🔁 From FrontEnd to BackEnd, I enjoy crafting seamless, scalable web applications that solve real-world problems.

🏦 **Currently @ Minsait (since 2024)**, working under contract with **Banco do Brasil**, where I develop mission-critical web applications for the financial market, including tools for trading, operations management, and market settlement systems.

🎓 **Graduated in Industrial Automation**, where I explored the intersection of software and hardware through projects involving Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi and Python — including smart home automation and embedded systems.

🌌 I’m driven by curiosity, technology, and imagination — from writing clean code to experimenting with electronics and building creative side projects that connect people, ideas and the future.
